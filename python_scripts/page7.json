On an unconventional path of his own design, Ross pairs a dark, mellow blast of modern country rock with a warm vocal rasp, heart-on-his-sleeve writing and addictive hooks that respect no borders genre or otherwise. Pulling influence everywhere from Guns N Roses and Metallica to country-rock outlaw Steve Earle, the former collegiate football player has leveraged his knack for emotional song craft into a series of Platinum-certified Top 5 Canadian country radio hits. His dusky power ballad Trouble rose to #1 in Canada, leading Ross to a CCMA Breakthrough Artist of the Year win. Now breaking through in the US, the rising star has tallied more than 300 million career streams and been hailed as an Artist to Watch by Spotify, Amazon Music, Pandora, MusicRow, the Grand Ole Opry and more. Touring alongside hard-rocking superstars like Nickelback, Brantley Gilbert and Bailey Zimmerman, he has already headlined his own sold-out run and will embark on select dates of Luke Bryans Mind of a Country Boy Tour this summer. Ross will release his new EP Complicated on March 29, co-writing seven of the projects eight tracks. With thundering drums meeting steel guitars and the melodies of heartland pop, tracks like his current chart-climber Single Again show off Ross rich, edgy vocal set to a barroom anthem. Complicated arrives just five years after Ross arrived in Nashville, proving theres much more to come from this next-generation talent whos anything but standard.

Featuring a three-piece horn section, the groups music harkens back to earlier soul and funk influences while hinting at the jazz foundations that brought the bands members together. Along with singer and guitarist Tom Eddy, bassist MarkHunter and drummer Jarred Katz are equally at home in a tight-pocketed groove as they are spacious free-improvisation. Trumpet player Brennan Carter joined by saxophonists Evan Smith and Levi Gillis serve as the bands melodic counterpoint, playing off Eddys vocals to create adistinct sonic character that has drawn in millions of listeners to date.Love Direction, the follow-up to 2022s Sticking With It (which landed at #1 on the Billboard Current Rs fourth full-length studio album and second for Dualtone Records, due out 7/12/24. This new record is the sound of the band taking their next step forward. The interplay of old and new is on full display throughout the album; and, the group augments their classic sound with an expanded instrumentation throughout. Eddy says of the albums inspiration: As you get further along in a relationship, sometimes you lose your way. The things that came easily in the beginning get hard. The love is still there, its just that people and life are complicated. Sometimes you dont have the tools in the toolbox to figure out what you need to do to support the other person, so you have to get help and ask for directions.Still, despite the title, this latest record isnt a collection of straightforward love songs, but an investigation into the different angles and challenges that relationships can bring. Expanding on the albums theme, Eddy further notes These arent Love Songs in the most obvious sense. They deal with the middle stages, the hinterlands of love and life together - figuring someone out and what they need, learning how to communicate, and examining your own faults. We set out to write music that felt more grown, a little wiser. The songs that emerged all pointed in the Love Direction.Their last album cycle saw the band headline and sell-out shows at iconic venues across the country. They have also had the opportunity to support new friends like Lake Street Dive and The Black Pumas, while also appearing at major festivals including Bonnaroo and Outside Lands. No strangers to the road, this new album represents a reflection on the bands touring gravitas as well as the promise of a new destination appearing on the horizon. Directions now in hand, The Dip is looking forward to furthering this exploration into all matters of the heart by bringing this expansive and detailed new recording to life in their next travels together.","pleaseNote":"This event is 17 and over.

decade, but their newest album, The Window, marks the first time theyd ever traveled outside their home base of Chicago to make a record, journeying to the Hall of Justice Recording Studio in Seattle to work with producer Chris Walla. The sessions with Walla (Death Cab for Cutie, Tegan and Sara, Foxing) struck the perfect balance between preparation and experimentation, injecting new life into the bands style of soft-hearted Midwestern indie rock with an ever so subtle Americana twist. The solidified Ratboys lineup stretched and expanded their vision in the studio, adding unexpected elements and instruments like rototoms, talkboxes, and fiddles. The result is Ratboys most sonically diverse record, shifting wildly from track to track. It flexes everything from fuzzy power pop choruses on Crossed That Line and Its Alive! to a warm country twang on Morning Zoo to mournful folk on the titular track. After more than ten years and four studio albums, The Window finally captures Ratboys as they were always meant to be heardexpansive while still intimate, audacious while still tenderthe sound of four friends operating as a single, cohesive unit.","pleaseNote":"This event is 17 and over.

A Georgia native and Air Force vet who grew up on a steady diet of Nickelback, Three Doors Down, Creed, and Alan Jackson, the Nashville newcomer has bucked Nashvilles 10-year town moniker, arriving in 2022 and quickly starting work to make grunge country a household name. With distorted, dark-energy guitars, thundering drums, and a wounded vocal at the end of its emotional rope, his gritty debut single Excuse the Mess has now racked up more than 36 million streams and landed elite playlist placements across Spotify, Apple Music, Pandora and more. The rising star counts 290+ million global career streams to his credit, plus a rare SiriusXM Highway Find accolade a prestigious recognition that has been bestowed on now-superstars like Maren Morris and Luke Combs, and he is only the second artist ever chosen for SiriusXMs Artist Accelerator program. In June, Snell will release his debut album, Still Bleeding, featuring his breakout hit Pray All the Way Home, which is now going for ads at country radio, as well as the previously released tracks Everybodys Friend and Wildfire. This summer, you can catch him on Jason Aldeans Highway Desperado tour.","pleaseNote":"This event is 21 and over.

composer and producer Will Miller. Their self-titled debut album was released by International Anthem in 2019. Wide acclaim for Resavoir included Pitchfork, who called it a complex, soulful album that celebrates interconnectedness, VICE, who called it lush and lovely, and Best of 2019 lists by NPR Music, Bandcamp, and BBC 6 Musics Gilles Peterson. In late 2019, Resavoir performed at the first Boiler Room Festival in London. During that trip, they recorded a cover of the Charles Tolliver song Plight at legendary London jazz hub, Total Refreshment Centre, which would later be released on the Blue Note Records compilation Transmissions from Total Refreshment Centre. In November 2023, Resavoir released their second self-titled album on International Anthem; and in December Miller debuted revamped versions of the live ensemble for performances at Londons Church of Sound, Brooklyns Pioneer Works, and Knoxvilles Big Ears Festival. The year 2024 sees Resavoir releasing a few loosie remixes and singles, followed by their first European tour in November, and culminating in the largest live iteration of the band yet Orchestra Resavoir which will debut at Chicagos Thalia Hall in December.","pleaseNote":"This event is 17 and over.

home, the Faroe Islands, is a small island country in the North Atlantic, which was populated by Scandinavians in the Viking Age. Originally incorporated into the Norwegian kingdom in the medieval period, the Faroese have found themselves subject to foreign rule for over 1000 years. Today, the country is a semi-autonomous part of the Danish kingdom, but it has had its own government since 1948. Eivr is strongly inspired by the Faroese natural scenery and traditional culture. It is a land of extremes, full of contrasts, with heavy, dark winters, and bright, joyful summers. Growing up in a small village among the characteristic steep cliffs and grassy hills, Eivr is deeply inspired by the unique Faroese landscape and its vibrant traditional folk music. Despite centuries of foreign rule, the Faroese folk culture has persevered, especially through communal singing and dancing. This cultural resilience in the face of a harsh nature andforeign dominance strongly informs Eivrs music: A very strong part of Faroese culture is singing togetheranywhere people gather, there will be singing, Eivr explains. When you listen to old Faroese traditional music, its sung acapella and takes you back to its Renaissance roots. Its pure, expressive, and untamed.Eivr has cultivated her distinct guttural singing technique under inspiration from beatboxing, throat-singing, and heavy metal growling to convey the untamed expressiveness inherent to traditional Faroese music and culture. It is a primal call to return to her roots in natural landscape of her birthplace.Often considered to be one of the most prolific and unique Nordic artists of her generation, Eivr has released 11 studio albums to date, crossing musical genres and always pushing the bounds of the expected. Awarded with the Nordic Council Music Price in 2021, Eivrs musical journey continues to fascinate.After independently releasing her music for many years, ENN marks Eivrs debut for the metal label Season of Mistand though her compositions sit outside of any one genre, she is happy to be embraced by the metal community. She identified a shared pagan sensibility in her television scores like The Last Kingdom. I never felt I really fit into any box, said Eivr. I just have to do it my own way. Recorded with her touring band in the Faroe Islandswhere she now lives again, splitting time between her homeland and DenmarkEivr called ENN my most pleasurable and also most painful process. I felt that I was stepping into a place where I hadnt been before, and thats always scary because you dont feel that you touch the ground. But it opens up your creativity and takes you to someplace new. Its woven together all my experiences for the past 10 years, and its grounded me.","pleaseNote":"This event is 17 and over.

Taylor & Pat ThomasImmerse yourself in a night of rich musical heritage and cross-cultural rhythms, featuring the legendary Ghanaian guitarist, composer, and producer Ebo Taylor. With a career spanning over half a century, Taylors influence on African music is undeniable, from his early days with highlife bands like the Stargazers to collaborations with Afrobeat pioneer Fela Kuti. Taylors innovative blend of traditional Ghanaian music with jazz, funk, and Afrobeat creates a signature sound showcased in albums like Ebo Taylor and Tower Nyame. Experience the evolution of Taylors musical journey, from his pioneering horn arrangements to his timeless classics like Heaven, as he takes the audience on a soul-stirring exploration of African rhythms andmelodies. This special evening celebrates Taylors enduring legacy and contributions to the global music scene, promising an unforgettable fusion of sounds and cultures.Ebo Taylor BioBorn in 1936, Ghanaian guitarist, composer, arranger, bandleader, and producer Ebo Taylor has been a vital presence in African music for more than half-a-century. During the early 60s, he was active in the influential highlife bands the Stargazers and the Broadway Dance Band whose singles were mainstays on national radio. In 1962 he took his Black Star Highlife Band to London and collaborated with other African musicians who were also in Britain at the time, including Fela Kuti. Back in Ghana, he worked as an influential producer, crafting recordings for Pat Thomas (his future collaborator) and C.K. Mann, among many others. During the 70s, his own musical projects combined traditional Ghanaian music with Afro-beat, jazz, and funk, creating a trademark sound asevidenced by the albums Ebo Taylor the Pelikans (1976) and Twer Nyame (1978). In the 80s, albums such as Conflict Nkru! and Hitsville Re-Visited (co-billed to Thomas) by his Uhuru-Yenzu band delivered a rawer, more immediate sound. Over the next two decades, Taylor was a noted producer, arranger, and composer, workingwith Thomas, Mann, Gyedu-Blay Ambolley , Kofi Yankson, and dozens of others. He returned to performing live in the early 21st century after hip-hop producers began sampling his work. Soundways Records released the compilation Ghana Special. In 2010, Strut Records released Love and Death, his first internationally distributed album, followed by a series of catalog reissues and all-new recordings including 2018s Yen Ara.Pat Thomas BioPat Thomas is a Ghanaian vocalist and songwriter famed for his work in the highlife bands of Ebo Taylor and his own recordings of Afrobeat and Afro-pop.Born in Agona, in the Ashanti region, Thomas had music almost literally in his DNA, his father was a music theory instructor and his mother a bandleader. In the 1970s, he moved to Accra to join Ebo Taylors legendary highlife band The Blue Monks; their residency at the Tip Toe Night Club is an important part of modern Ghanaian culturalhistory. In the later years he moved to the Ivory Coast and produced various records in Afro-beat, Afro-Latin sounds and reggae melded to funky African disco.","pleaseNote":"This event is 17 and over.

has partnered with PLUS1 so that $1 per ticket goes to supporting organizations working for equity, access, and dignity for all. www.plus1.orgCigarettes burn in the moonlight. Necklaces bang against bare chests. And on their triumphant fifth album Poetry, Dehd transports us to a world steeped in imagery. Its a world painted in the sunset tones of summer romance and flickering old flames. Its motorcycle chrome (Mood Ring), its fake Gucci Sunglasses (Dog Days), and its shaking hands before a swaying lover (Hard to Love).Across fourteen songs, the trioJason Balla, Emily Kempf, and Eric McGradythrow themselves against the question of what it means to hope, knowing all too well that things end and hearts can break. You cant beat death, but you can beat death in life, wrote Charles Bukowski and upon listening to this album its obvious the band has chosen to attempt the latter. After hitting a stride with their 2020 breakout record Flower of Devotion, followed by their radiant Fat Possum debut Blue Skies in 2022, Dehd did something different. They turned a writing session into a road trip.With a van full of recording equipment they headed to Kempfs off-grid Earthship in New Mexico where they chopped wood to keep warm and worked for as long as the solar panels held a charge. They then traveled north to a borrowed cabin surrounded by the chilly waters of the Puget Sound, where the hours were marked only by the movement of the tide. On the way back to Chicago for their final writing session at the warehouse theyve called home for over a decade, Balla and McGrady became stranded for days in rural Montana after hitting a deer and abandoning their van. This tireless sense of adventure, both internal and external, has become a trademark of Dehd over the years. Eating, sleeping, breathingour only purpose was to write, Kempf recalled. And it seems in this place of quiet focus Dehd have achieved their most honest and vulnerable writing yet.In the studio they tapped Ziyad Asrar (of Whitney) to co-produce alongside Balla, marking their first time collaborating with someone outside of the band for the recording process. With the addition of Asrar the emotional landscape of the record is vividly rendered, at times confessional and others anthemic, vocals bared, up front with the confidence of a band that knows the power of their words.No one writes about love quite like Dehd, and on Poetry, they somehow make even heartbreak sound inviting. In the swirl of budding new relationships and lingering breakups, their lyrics find themselves at once exalting love and then turning to doubt it. Examining their own self-defeating habits. I let myself get in the way, turning every thought to jealousy, admits Balla on Light On, But was it worth losing a home?","pleaseNote":"This event is 17 and over.

After hitting a stride with their 2020 breakout record Flower of Devotion, followed by their radiant Fat Possum debut Blue Skies in 2022, Dehd did something different. They turned a writing session into a road trip.With a van full of recording equipment they headed to Kempfs off-grid Earthship in New Mexico where they chopped wood to keep warm and worked for as long as the solar panels held a charge. They then traveled north to a borrowed cabin surrounded by the chilly waters of the Puget Sound, where the hours were marked only by the movement of the tide. On the way back to Chicago for their final writing session at the warehouse theyve called home for over a decade, Balla and McGrady became stranded for days in rural Montana after hitting a deer and abandoning their van. This tireless sense of adventure, both internal and external, has become a trademark of Dehd over the years. Eating, sleeping, breathingour only purpose was to write, Kempf recalled. And it seems in this place of quiet focus Dehd have achieved their most honest and vulnerable writing yet.In the studio they tapped Ziyad Asrar (of Whitney) to co-produce alongside Balla, marking their first time collaborating with someone outside of the band for the recording process. With the addition of Asrar the emotional landscape of the record is vividly rendered, at times confessional and others anthemic, vocals bared, up front with the confidence of a band that knows the power of their words.No one writes about love quite like Dehd, and on Poetry, they somehow make even heartbreak sound inviting. In the swirl of budding new relationships and lingering breakups, their lyrics find themselves at once exalting love and then turning to doubt it. Examining their own self-defeating habits. I let myself get in the way, turning every thought to jealousy, admits Balla on Light On, But was it worth losing a home?","pleaseNote":"This event is 17 and over.
