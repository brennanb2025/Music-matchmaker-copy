If you do not have a pre-paid coupon, here are some options for you: If you prefer to tailgate before the Bears games, you can park in the 31st Street McCormick Place Lot. It costs $16 and there are shuttle buses to bring you to the 18th Street Shuttle Turnaround, directly across from the stadium. You can also walk to the stadium from the 31st Street Lot. If you don't want to tailgate, we recommend you park in the East Monroe Street / Millennium Park garages, located at Columbus Drive and Monroe Street. It costs $13 and you can then take the free shuttle directly to the 18th Street Shuttle Turnaround. The shuttle bus takes about 10 minutes because it travels on a specially designed bus way which keeps it out of most Soldier Field traffic. There are over 40 buses continuously shuttling fans beginning five hours prior to kickoff. Lastly, we recommend taking public transportation. The Transportation Center, located northeast of the stadium (at the corner of McFetridge and Museum Campus Drive) is where the CTA, Metra shuttle, and PACE bus services will be available for fans drop-off and pick-up. The CTA's train service for the Red, Orange or Green Lines are available at the Roosevelt Road and State Street Station.

approximately 28 days prior to the show.No one paid too much attention when Jake Lenderman recorded Boat Songs, his third album released under his initials, MJ Lenderman. Before he cut it, after all, he was a 20-year-old guitarist working at an ice cream shop in his mountain hometown of Asheville, North Carolina, getting away for self-booked tours of his own songs or with the band hed recently joined, Wednesday, whenever possible.But as the pandemic took hold just as he turned 21, Lendermanthen making more money through state unemployment than he had ever serving scoopsenjoyed the sudden luxury of free time. Every day, he would read, paint, and write; every night, he and his roommates, bandmates, and best friends would drink and jam in their catawampus rental home, singing whatever came to mind over their collective racket. Some of those lines stuck around the next morning, slowly becoming 2021s self-made Ghost of Your Guitar Solo and then 2022s Boat Songs, recorded in a proper studio for a grand. With its barbed little jokes, canny sports references, and gloriously ragged guitar solos, Boat Songs became one of that years biggest breakthroughs, a ramshackleset of charms and chuckles. Much the same happened for Wednesday. Suddenly, people were paying a lot of attention to what Jake Lenderman might make next.The answer is Manning Fireworks, recorded at Ashevilles Drop of Sun during multiple four-day stints whenever Lenderman had a break from the road. Coproducing it with pal and frequent collaborator Alex Farrar, Lenderman plays nearly every instrument here. It is not only his fourth full-length and studio debut for ANTI- but also a remarkable development in his story as an incredibly incisive singer-songwriter, whose propensity for humor always points to some uneasy, disorienting darkness. He wrote and made it with full awareness of the gaze Boat Songs had generated, how people now expected something great. Rather than wither, however, Lenderman used that pressure to ask himself what kind of musician he wanted to bethe funny cynic in the corner forever ready with a riposte or barbed bon mot, or one who could sort through his sea ofcultural jetsam and one-liners to say something real about himself and his world, to figure out how he fits into all this mess?He chose, of course, the latter. As a result, Manning Fireworks is an instant classic of an LP, his frank introspection and observation finding the intersection of wit and sadness and taking up residence there for 39 minutes. Yes, the punchlines are still here, as are the rusted-wire guitar solos that have made Lenderman a favorite for indie rock fans looking for an emerging guitar hero. (Speaking of solos, did you hear him leading his totally righteous band, the Wind, on his lauded live cassette last year? Wow.) But theres a new sincerity, too, as Lenderman lets listeners clearly see the world through his warped lens, perhaps for the first time. Please dont laugh, he deadpans during Joker Lips, a magnetic song about feeling pushed out by everyone else. Only half of what I said was a joke. Maybe you hear a tremble in his voice? Thats the frown behindthe mask, finally slipping from Lendermans face.","pleaseNote":"This event is 17 and over.

Before he cut it, after all, he was a 20-year-old guitarist working at an ice cream shop in his mountain hometown of Asheville, North Carolina, getting away for self-booked tours of his own songs or with the band hed recently joined, Wednesday, whenever possible.But as the pandemic took hold just as he turned 21, Lendermanthen making more money through state unemployment than he had ever serving scoopsenjoyed the sudden luxury of free time. Every day, he would read, paint, and write; every night, he and his roommates, bandmates, and best friends would drink and jam in their catawampus rental home, singing whatever came to mind over their collective racket. Some of those lines stuck around the next morning, slowly becoming 2021s self-made Ghost of Your Guitar Solo and then 2022s Boat Songs, recorded in a proper studio for a grand. With its barbed little jokes, canny sports references, and gloriously ragged guitar solos, Boat Songs became one of that years biggest breakthroughs, a ramshackleset of charms and chuckles. Much the same happened for Wednesday.

It figures that a band with this abrasive, unrelenting, and outlandish of a sound has stuck as strong of a chord as it has. Dread has replaced the American dream, and Chat Piles music is a poignant reminder of that shift a portrait of an American rock band molded by a society defined by its cold and cruel power systems.Besides being the name of a largely forgotten (and panned) 90s film, Cool World makes for an apt title of Chat Piles sophomore full-length record. In the context of a Chat Pile record, the words are steeped in a grim double entendre that not only evokes imagery of a dying planet but a progression from the bands previous work, moving the scope of its depiction of modern malaise from just Gods country to the entirety of humankind. Cool World covers similar themes to our last album, except now exploded from a micro to macro scale, with thoughts specifically about disasters abroad, at home, and how they affect one another, says vocalist Raygun Busch.Though very much on-brand with Chat Piles signature flavor of cacophonous, sludgy noise rock, the bands shift to a global thematic focus on Cool World not only compliments the broader experimentations it employs with their songwriting but also how they dissect the albums core theme of violence. Melded into the bands twisted foundational sound are traces of other eclectic genre stylings, with examples of gazy, goth-tinged dirges to abrasive yet anthemic alt/indie-esque hooks and off-kilter metal grooves only scratching the surface of what can be heard in the albums ten tracks. While we wanted our follow-up to Gods Country to still capture the immediate, uncompromising essence of Chat Pile, we also knew that with Cool World, wed want to stretch the definition of our sound to reflect our tastes beyond just noise rock territory, reflects bassist Stin. Now that we had some form of creative comfort zones in place after hitting that milestone of putting out a full-length record, album #2 felt like the perfect opportunity to challenge those limits. Besides stylistically stretching the boundaries of the Chat Pile sound, Cool World is also the bands first record to have someone else handle mixing duties, with Ben Greenberg of Uniform (Algiers, Drab Majesty, Metz) capturing and further amplifying the quartets unmistakably outsider and folk-art edge.If I had to describe the album in one sentence, explains Busch, Its hard not to borrow from Voltaire, so I wont resist Cool World is about the price at which we eat sugar in America.Cool World will be released via The Flenser on October 11, 2024Chat Pile is:Raygun Busch - VocalsLuther Manhole - GuitarStin - BassCapn Ron - Drums","pleaseNote":"This event is 17 and over.

In essence, this phenomenon occurs at the lowest of low moments and during the highest of high moments. MisterWives examine both ends of this spectrum in their music. The platinum-certified Los Angeles-based quintetMandy Lee [vocals], Etienne Bowler [drums, production], Marc Campbell [guitar], Mike Murphy [keyboards], and William Hehir [bass]absorb lifes ups and downs and recalibrate them in the form of snappy alternative rock anthems underlined by unexpectedly hip-shaking rhythms and identifiable tattoo-worthy lyrics.They meet everyone in the middle of these extremes on their fourth full-length offering, Nosebleeds [Resilient Little Records/Photo Finish Records].The title encompasses multiple meanings, Mandy notes. Theres the physical aspect of taking relentless punches and visibly showing the effects. Theres another aspect of being up high outside of the world. Were exploring all of these sides. I tried to be vulnerable and raw about my experience. As a kid, music was my escape and my safe space. At a really tumultuous time, I needed to write and feel excited about music once more. It was cathartic for what Id been through.The theme is fitting in terms of how we started, Etienne adds. We had no band or shows, but we had an excitement about making music and dreaming of what was going to happen. Not matter what stage youre at, this excitement helps you get to the next level. A decade later, the same innocence returned to us.","pleaseNote":"Ticket Fee includes 1% City Amusement

t just a band; its a living and breathing entity. Like any other sentient being, it consumes, evolves, and transforms from one season to the next.Its shape may change though its spirit remains the same. Founded and fronted by Manuel Gagneux, it has only sharpened its claws, lengthened its teeth, and steeled its nerves over the years, growing more undeniable and unpredictable in the process.After gathering tens of millions of streams and earning widespread critical acclaim, this beast proves as dynamic and dangerous as ever on its fourth full-length album, GREIF.Zeal Manuel observes.Its definitely a restless organism that I have the privilege of raising.Hes done a hell of a job raising it so far...In 2017, Zeal near perfection in a 4.5-out-of-5 star review, while The Line of Best of Fithailed, Zeal The band graced the cover of KERRANG!, while the record landed high in the charts in multiple countries globally.However, Manuel decided to switch up the process for GREIF. Rather than creatively fly solo, he welcomed his bandmates into the studio. As such, the musiciansTiziano Volante [guitar], Marc Obrist [vocals], Denis Wagner [vocals], Lukas Kurmann [bass], and Marco Von Allmen [drums]spread their wings alongside him.The guys basically gave this project seven years of their lives on tour, so it felt odd to be the only one on the albums,he says.The sound is more of an analog to what we do on stage. You get the same idiots, just on vinyl, he laughs.Weve really evolved into a tight-knit unit,adds Marc.Before Zeal re like a little family now. Each member brings his own unique flavor to the mix, and we all try to make Manuels songs better in our own way. The most interesting part for me was the new approach of how we work together in the studio.Decamping to Marcs studio Hutch Sounds in Switzerland, the record came to life in just five months.The frontman excitedly leveraged the talents of his cohorts, featuring three voices for the first time and emboldening the sound from every angle. I wanted to expand upon what we had and introduce new colors, he goes on.There are angry and accusatory moments, but theres also some solace and happiness. Im widening the palette of colors we have to paint with. These are avenues we havent tried.Tiziano concurs, This album feels like a warm homecoming into a place of uncertainty. What could be described as the start of an other era artistically is probably more of a coming to life of a bigger beast in the form of a more communicative and better organized collective.","pleaseNote":"This event is 17 and over.

full-length record and first for ANTI-, their vocabulary often defaults to synesthetic imagery and sensation.We have so many visual cues for how we talk about music, singer and guitarist Emily Massey says as she stops herself in the middle of explaining how the albums second song, Doubt, sounds like wakeboarding. Doubt is quite dark lyrically, but it is found in this upbeat and almost campy environment.On Yard, the Wisconsin-bred, Chicago-based four-piece nestles comfortably into pockets of nuance, impressions, contradictions sonics and lyrics finessed together to bottle the specific tension of a feeling youve never quite been able to find the right words for. In that regard, listening to Slow Pulp can feel like being in a room with someone whos known you so long that they can read your every micro-expression and pinpoint exactly how youre feeling before you can. Perhaps this spawns from the bands own shared history and chemistry; in various ways, the four of them grew up are still growing up together.Guitarist Henry Stoehr and drummer Teddy Mathews attended elementary school together in Madison. Not long after, they met bassist Alex Leeds at the west side location of the now-closed local music program called GoodnLoud Music. And while Massey didnt enter the fold until later on in college at the University of Wisconsin-Madison with Mathews and Stoehr, it turns out she was in the same program on the other side of town at GoodnLouds east side location. In fact, the chords to Yards addictive track Slugs are from a song Stoehr wrote for his crush in the sixth grade. Imagination, Mathews immediately chimes in with the name of Stoehrs original. The albums iteration of the song is, fittingly, also about a crush: Youre a summer hit, Im singing it, Massey swoons over a warm wave of guitar fuzz and syrupy background vocals.With Leeds attending college in Minneapolis and the other members in Madison, the quartet started recording, playing shows around the Midwest, and eventually released their first EP as a four-piece, EP2, in 2017. Its an intimate, restless, and decidedly lo-fi 17-minute debut by a band with an obvious knack for creating sticky hooks that tend to stay in the space behind your eyes long after the songs are finished playing. So obvious that, without much promotion on the bands end, EP2 picked up traction across YouTube channels and blogs, and thanks to the power of the internet, Slow Pulp unexpectedly found themselves amid their first wave of buzz.","pleaseNote":"This event is 17 and over.

Check. Songs that are play-on-repeat heart punches? Check. Songs that are poetic and thought-provoking while also being absolute belt-at-the-top-of-your-voice-with-the-windows-down masterpieces? Check. Its all here.For the past 30 years, Nada Surf has had the same core lineup: Matthew Caws, DanielLorca, and Ira Elliot. Moon Mirror, their first for New West Records, was produced by theband and Ian Laughton at Rockfield Studios in Wales. For the recording, Matthew, Daniel, and Ira were joined by their friend and longtime keyboard player Louie Lino.Moon Mirror is a thrilling and moving leap forward for Nada Surf. The songs on the album are true to the human experienceas meaningful and mysterious and sometimes absurd as it is.Theres love, yes, but also grief, deep loneliness, doubt, wonder, and hope. These arenot the songs of a band in their 20s. There is hard-won wisdom here, and hard-won belief in possibilitythe kind that comes from falling down and getting back up.Give Me The Sun (Im looking for something/ I cant say exactly what), Second Skin(Im tired of living in this second skin/ I want to let everything in), and MoonMirror(connect me to something) grapple with being present and open, paying attention, and seeking connection in a world that feels alienating with its everything-all-at-once-ness.In Front of Me Now is a song against multi-tasking and sleepwalking through the one life we have. The song asks, Why wasnt I present? I could have been living, and shows us a transformation in the chorus: Today, I do whats in front of me now. I dont know about you, but I need this reminder as much as ever. Nada Surf has been working together for decades, and theyre consistently excellent, but they always surprise me. Thats what great art does. For nearly 30 years, Nada Surf has been a part of the soundtrack of my life. Our lives. I fell hard for the band over Let Go in 2002, and following that, The Weight Is a Gift, in 2005. Those songs are lodged in my body,someplace theyll never be extracted from. So are songs from The Proximity Effect, Lucky, The Stars Are Indifferent to Astronomy, and Never Not Together, which was my favorite record of 2020. Moon Mirror will take its place among the others, in heavy rotation.Four years ago, during lockdown, I was listening to Nada Surf one morning. My son, then seven years old, was quiet, and then he said, They sing a lot about love. What he said next has stuck with me: It protects you. Love protects you. If you need convincing, I think Moon Mirror will do just that. Lucky, lucky us to have had Nada Surfs music with us for all of these years, and lucky, lucky us to have these new songs now, right when we need them most.

body of work both strangely enchanted and painfully self-aware, unfolding in songs sparked from Greek myths and frenzied dreams and late-night drives in the depths of summer delirium. True to its charmed complexity, the singer/songwriter/pianists second full-length came to life over the course of a tumultuous year spent living in a possibly haunted church in Chicago. The result: a portrait of profound upheaval and weary resilience, presented in a kaleidoscopic sound thats endlessly absorbing.The follow-up to Franciss 2019 debut Changesa New Orleans-Rthe reincarnation of Allen Toussaint by BBC Radio 6In Plain Sight was written and recorded almost entirely at the church, a now-defunct congregation called St. Peters UCC. Despite not identifying as religious, Francis took a music-ministry job at the church in 2017 at the suggestion of a friend. After breaking up with his longtime girlfriend while on tour in fall 2019, he returned to his hometown and found himself with no place to stay, then headed to St. Peters and asked to move into the parsonage. I thought Id only stay a few months but it turned into over a year, and I knew I had to do something to take advantage of this miraculous gift of a situation, he says.Mixed by Grammy Award-winner Dave Fridmann (HAIM, Spoon, The Flaming Lips, Tame Impala), In Plain Sight finds Francis again joining forces with Changes producer and analog obsessive Sergio Rios (a guitarist/engineer known for his work with CeeLo Green and Alicia Keys). Like its predecessor, the album spotlights Franciss refined yet free-spirited performance on piano, an instrument he took up at the age of four. From a very early age, I was playing late into the night in a very stream-of-consciousness kind of way, he says, naming everything from ragtime to gospel soul to The Who among his formative influences. With a prodigy-like gift for piano, Francis sat in with a dozen different blues acts in Chicago clubs as a teenager, and helmed a widely beloved instrumental funk band called The Heard before going solo. Along with earning lavish acclaim (including a glowing review from Bob Lefsetz, who declared: THIS IS THE FUTURE OF THE MUSIC BUSINESS!), Changes led to such triumphs as performing live on KCRWs Morning Becomes Eclectic, sharing the stage with members of The Meters at the New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival, and touring with such acts as Lee Fields & The Expressions and Black Pumas.","pleaseNote":"This event is 17 and over.

Nash isnt finished shape-shifting just yet; in June, shell release her fifth album, 9 Sad Symphonies, under the legendary label Kill Rock Stars. Inspired by old Hollywood, vintage musicals and a desperate quest to find beauty in a rotten world, its another sonic shift following her rage-y recent output. Two things fueled that moment of the albums creation: her work on Only Gold, a musical Nash co-created, and a global pandemic that curtailed filming on the fourth season of GLOW and sent Nash and everyone into a tailspin. These melodic, bright-on-the-surface but deeply layered songs started to emerge out of creative scenarios that had been completely changed by the pandemic. On 9 Sad Symphonies, Nash has taken another huge step towards cementing her place as one of Britains most unique and fearless talents.","pleaseNote":"This event is 17 and over.

Doubt is quite dark lyrically, but it is found in this upbeat and almost campy environment.On Yard, the Wisconsin-bred, Chicago-based four-piece nestles comfortably into pockets of nuance, impressions, contradictions sonics and lyrics finessed together to bottle the specific tension of a feeling youve never quite been able to find the right words for. In that regard, listening to Slow Pulp can feel like being in a room with someone whos known you so long that they can read your every micro-expression and pinpoint exactly how youre feeling before you can. Perhaps this spawns from the bands own shared history and chemistry; in various ways, the four of them grew up are still growing up together.Guitarist Henry Stoehr and drummer Teddy Mathews attended elementary school together in Madison. Not long after, they met bassist Alex Leeds at the west side location of the now-closed local music program called GoodnLoud Music. And while Massey didnt enter the fold until later on in college at the University of Wisconsin-Madison with Mathews and Stoehr, it turns out she was in the same program on the other side of town at GoodnLouds east side location. In fact, the chords to Yards addictive track Slugs are from a song Stoehr wrote for his crush in the sixth grade. Imagination, Mathews immediately chimes in with the name of Stoehrs original. The albums iteration of the song is, fittingly, also about a crush: Youre a summer hit, Im singing it, Massey swoons over a warm wave of guitar fuzz and syrupy background vocals.With Leeds attending college in Minneapolis and the other members in Madison, the quartet started recording, playing shows around the Midwest, and eventually released their first EP as a four-piece, EP2, in 2017. Its an intimate, restless, and decidedly lo-fi 17-minute debut by a band with an obvious knack for creating sticky hooks that tend to stay in the space behind your eyes long after the songs are finished playing. So obvious that, without much promotion on the bands end, EP2 picked up traction across YouTube channels and blogs, and thanks to the power of the internet, Slow Pulp unexpectedly found themselves amid their first wave of buzz.","pleaseNote":"This event is 17 and over.
